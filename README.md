## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
CSS is proving to be the most challenging aspect of this prework. 
As a less experienced front-end developer, I'm still learning and having a hard time with certain CSS concepts. 
To speed up the process, I've incorporated online templates, such as the hamburger menu, into my project. 
However, effectively integrating these templates requires a solid understanding of the underlying CSS, which presents its own set of challenges.
